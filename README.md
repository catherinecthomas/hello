**Author: Catherine Thomas**

**Last updated: January 10, 2017**

**Description**: This is the README for a new git repository (repo) called "hello". Its purpose is to practice editing files (like code), tracking those changes through "add" -> "commit" (to local comp) -> "push" (to GitHub). 

**GitHub**: [catherinecthomas/hello](https://github.com/catherinecthomas/hello)

## Steps
NB: make Heading 1 w 1 hastag

#### Step 1: Formatting README
NB: make Heading 2 w 3 hashtags
 - [Markdown Formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
 - NB: you make links by putting text in brackets followed by link in parentheses
 - you can make smile with :smile: (colons on either side of word)
 - _italics_, **bold**

#### Step 2: Make pset
 - Use R to create a pset0.R and commit it to repo and then push to github
 
#### Step 3: Make changes to pset
 - Make changes, commit those changes, review them (`git log` and `git diff`), revert back to old commits (`git checkout "commit#"`), get back to where you started (`git checkout master`), revert to previous versions (`git revert --no-commit "commit#"..HEAD` OR `git revert --no-commit "commit#"`)
 
#### Step 4: create .gitignore hidden file
